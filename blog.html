  <h1>Dustwalkers: The Road to Somalia</h1>
  <p><em>By Karieson</em></p>
  <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Adventure / Magical Realism / African Folklore</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Dedication</h2>
  <p>To my grandmother—<br>
  who raised me with love, prayers, and quiet strength.<br>
  Your faith still walks beside me.</p>

  <p>To my friends—Farhan, Yasin, Omar—<br>
  we took the first steps together.<br>
  This story will always carry your footprints.</p>

  <p>And to anyone who has ever walked toward something uncertain,<br>
  not knowing what tomorrow holds—<br>
  this is for you.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Author’s Note</h2>
  <p>This is a work of fiction—but it was born from truths.
  It began in a town like Isiolo, where early morning prayers mingled with quiet conversations. 
  The characters in this story didn’t know exactly where they were going—only that they had to keep moving.</p>

  <p>Somalia, for them, wasn’t just a place on a map.
  It was a dream. A chance. Maybe even a kind of hope.</p>

  <p>The people you’ll meet in these pages aren’t perfect. They don’t have much. 
  But they have each other—and sometimes, that’s enough to begin.</p>

  <p>This isn’t just a story about crossing borders.
  It’s about friendship, silence, risk—and the search for a life that feels truly your own.</p>

  <p>I’m not a professional storyteller. I’m just someone who’s lived close enough to the edge of this story to imagine what it might feel like—and what it might mean.  
  May you find a piece of your own courage here.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Chapter One: The Road Began at Fajr</h2>
  <p>The floor was cool beneath my forehead as I ended sujood. 
  The walls of the old mosque in Isiolo were cracked with age, but the silence inside felt whole. Peaceful. 
  It was Farhan who broke it.</p>

  <p>"Bro," he whispered, nudging my arm. "We ready?"</p>

  <p>The sky was still dark, stars clinging to the last of the night. 
  We had agreed to meet here—before Fajr prayer—at the old mosque where generations had come and gone, 
  where time felt slower and intentions clearer.</p>

  <p>Since the erupt of unemployment, I had drawn a quiet plan: to go to Somalia. 
  Not alone, but with brothers—Farhan, Yassin, and Omar. 
  Men I trusted, whose lives, like mine, had stalled in the waiting rooms of hardship. 
  Our bond was forged in shared frustration, but also in hope. 
  Together, we had decided: if opportunity wouldn’t come to us, we would go in search of it.</p>

  <p>The mosque air smelled of dust and old prayer mats. 
  We offered our prayer, quietly and with hearts heavy. 
  And then, as the first light began to rise, we stepped outside, into the stillness of dawn.</p>

  <p>My thoughts were ahead of my feet. 
  I was already on the road—far from Isiolo’s cracked pavements, beyond the familiar dust. 
  I saw the land changing in my mind: dry plains stretching to the horizon, border towns, foreign tongues. 
  And somewhere far ahead, Somalia—still unknown, but pulling me like a quiet promise.</p>

  <p>But first, I had to tell her.</p>

  <p>My grandmother’s house wasn’t far—just a short walk. Still, it felt like miles with the weight pressing down on me. 
  I had pictured the moment: standing in her doorway, the sun on my back, her eyes soft with concern as I told her the truth—where I was going, and why.</p>

  <p>But as I got closer, doubt crept in like a slow wind curling around my ankles. 
  What if she didn’t understand? What if she cried? 
  What if she looked at me with that quiet disappointment that said more than words ever could?</p>

  <p>My steps slowed. I thought of her hands—thin, worn, trembling slightly when they held mine. 
  I remembered the kisses I gave her the night before, the way she had closed her eyes and held me just a little longer. 
  Did she know already, somehow?</p>

  <p>I stopped at the corner of the street. Her house was just in sight. Still, I hesitated.  
  A war had broken out inside me—between the duty to tell her and the urge to protect her from pain. 
  Between truth and escape. Between home and something far more uncertain.</p>

  <p>And in the end, I chose the road.</p>

  <p>I turned away quietly, breath catching in my throat as I walked into the fading light. 
  Dust rose around my shoes with every step. 
  Behind me, her house slowly disappeared from view.</p>

  <p>Maybe one day, I would return—with stories, with reasons, with the kind of strength she always believed I had.  
  But that day, I chose silence—and the long road ahead.</p>

  <p>We didn’t tell our families everything. 
  Farhan said we were “going north for a few days,” but not how far. 
  Omar left a note under his pillow. 
  Yassin said nothing at all—he just prayed, kissed the Qur’an, and followed.</p>

  <p><em>That was 2018. The year everything changed.</em></p>

  <h1>Impact of Youth Unemployment in Kenya</h1>
<p><small>August 15, 2025</small></p>
  <h2>1. Economic Impacts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Slower economic growth</strong> – fewer people in productive jobs means less output and reduced national income.</li>
    <li><strong>Loss of tax revenue</strong> – unemployed youth aren’t contributing income taxes, yet they still need public services.</li>
    <li><strong>Increased dependency</strong> – more reliance on parents, relatives, or government support puts pressure on household finances.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Social Impacts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Higher crime rates</strong> – lack of income opportunities can push some youth toward theft, fraud, and other illegal activities.</li>
    <li><strong>Political instability</strong> – unemployed youth are more vulnerable to political manipulation, protests, and unrest.</li>
    <li><strong>Social exclusion</strong> – jobless youth may feel disconnected from society, leading to frustration and hopelessness.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Personal Impacts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mental health challenges</strong> – unemployment is linked to depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem.</li>
    <li><strong>Delayed life goals</strong> – difficulty affording marriage, starting a family, or building a home.</li>
    <li><strong>Skill erosion</strong> – the longer someone is unemployed, the more their skills become outdated.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. National Development Impacts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Wasted human potential</strong> – Kenya loses out on innovation and productivity that energetic, educated youth could offer.</li>
    <li><strong>Widening inequality</strong> – unemployment deepens the gap between rich and poor, especially in urban slums and rural areas.</li>
  </ul>
